This is my personal website. Here I will occasionally post my findings, tips and tricks and more generally share my perspectives regarding the software I build and use within my freelance activities and others.

I'm currently a 5<sup>th</sup> year student at Epitech, a French IT school, and I'm currently located in Paris, France.

I'm also actively looking for a part-time opportunity starting september 2017 in an ambitious start-up, preferably with funds and more than 10 employees as I had experiences with smaller start-ups already ([see my résumé for more](/assets/antoine-bolvy-resume.pdf)!).
