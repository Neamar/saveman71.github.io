    After being a fullstack Node.js for a french startup for one year, <a href="http://anyfetch.com">AnyFetch</a>, I decided to become a freelance developer. This unique experience gave me the opportunity to help design and scale a powerful API managing and indexing thousands of documents per day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I build documented and fully tested code, and follow a peer-reviewing process.
  </p>

  <p>This led me to contribute to open-source projects while maintaining tested repositories and producing documented and clean pull requests. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">Github</a>!
  </p>

  <p>Being in charge of product development is not a problem (I built a complex Chrome extension from the start to the end). I like being challenged daily with new issues, new programming frameworks (e.g. developed a multiplatform desktop email app over a week-end with Polymer.js and Electron).</p>

  <p>
    I really like the free software philosophy. I use a Linux environment (ArchLinux) as my daily driver.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm open for opportunities!
